# Cefault++
A tool to create a default C++ project structure with CMake.

I don't think this is unique, but made it anyways.

To use this be sure you have CMake and a C++ compiler ( I mean, I was not gonna say a Haskell compiler mate what are you doing here without a C++ compiler ).

# Usage
You can create a C++ project in the current working directory by running cfltpp in the build directory of this project ( with running ./cfltpp or .\cfltpp or however you execute stuff there ).
If you don't want it to build the project while making it you can do "./cfltpp no-build".
You can run it anywhere in Linux or MacOS by copying the cfltpp to /usr/bin/ or /bin/ etc. Learn how to do it yourself in Windows :/

Good luck with the projects mate
